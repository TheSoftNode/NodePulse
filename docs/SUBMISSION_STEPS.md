## üì¶ Step-by-Step: Docker Image Publication

### Step 1: Test Build Locally

```bash
cd /Users/apple/Desktop/Hackathons/nodeops/nodepulse

# Build the image
docker build -t nodepulse:latest .

# This will take 5-10 minutes
# Watch for any errors
```

### Step 2: Test Run Locally

```bash
# Run the container
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://nodepulse:nodepulse@nodepulse.a0ewlvl.mongodb.net/nodepulse" \
  -e CRON_SECRET="test-secret-key" \
  -e NODE_ENV="production" \
  --name nodepulse-test \
  nodepulse:latest

# Check logs
docker logs nodepulse-test

# Test access
open http://localhost:3000

# Should see dashboard loading
```

### Step 3: Tag for Docker Hub

```bash
# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Tag the image
docker tag nodepulse:latest YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/nodepulse:2.0.0
docker tag nodepulse:latest YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/nodepulse:latest

# Replace YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME with actual username
```

### Step 4: Push to Docker Hub

```bash
# Push both tags
docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/nodepulse:2.0.0
docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/nodepulse:latest

# This will take 5-10 minutes depending on connection
```

### Step 5: Verify on Docker Hub

1. Go to https://hub.docker.com
2. Find your nodepulse repository
3. Verify both tags are present (2.0.0 and latest)
4. Copy the image name: `YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME/nodepulse:2.0.0`
