## 🎬 Demo Script (5 Minutes to Win)

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "I was managing 8 DePIN nodes - Helium hotspots, Render GPUs, Arweave gateways. One morning, my best-earning Helium hotspot was down for 6 hours before I noticed. Lost $200 in rewards. I needed ONE dashboard that doesn't just MONITOR - but OPTIMIZES. So I built NodePulse."

**Show**: Landing page at http://localhost:3000

### Deploy (30 seconds)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/demo/seed
```

> "Production deployment? One Docker command. 60 seconds later, you're operational. Watch this - loading demo data... boom. 8 nodes across 4 networks and 8 countries. 400 health checks of history. All in 2 seconds."

**Show**: Dashboard populating with data

### The Innovation - Health Score (45 seconds)
Click into any node → Scroll to AI Insights

> "Here's where we're different. This node scores 92 out of 100. Network rank: Excellent. Top 8% of ALL Helium operators. See this insight? 'Outstanding uptime - 5.2% above network average.' No other platform tells you how you RANK."

**Point**: Health Score card

### The Innovation - Earnings Optimizer (45 seconds)
> "But here's the real value. Currently earning $125/month. Optimization score: 85%. Top recommendation: 'Improve uptime to 95%' - potential gain +$12/month. That's $144/year from ONE simple fix. And look - if I switched this hardware to Render? $800/month. 37% better ROI. Payback in 2-3 months."

**Point**: Earnings Optimizer card + Network comparison

### The Innovation - Predictive Alerts (45 seconds)
> "And this is the killer feature. AI-powered failure prediction. See this? '87% confidence of failure in next 6 hours. Response time increasing by 120ms per check. URGENT: Restart node immediately.' We're not telling you it's down. We're telling you it's ABOUT to go down. Six hours to prevent lost earnings."

**Point**: Red predictive alert card (if showing) or explain the algorithm

### Technical Excellence (30 seconds)
> "Built with Next.js 16 - literally released weeks ago. Full TypeScript. Server-Sent Events for real-time updates. MongoDB with statistical analysis. Linear regression for predictions. Z-scores for anomaly detection. This isn't just monitoring - it's intelligent operations."

**Show**: Code if time, or just emphasize tech stack

### Closing (30 seconds)
> "NodePulse doesn't just tell you if your node is up. It tells you:
> - How you rank vs the network
> - How to make more money
> - What failures are coming
> - Whether you should switch networks
>
> This is the operations intelligence platform the DePIN ecosystem needs. Thank you."
